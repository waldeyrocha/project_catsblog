Cat Blog
This is the source code for a blog about cats, with content in Portuguese. The blog is developed in HTML and CSS and provides information about the mysteries and legends related to cats, as well as articles related to activities and care for these fascinating felines.

## Blog Content
The blog consists of three main sections: header, body, and footer.

Header
The header contains the blog's logo, a search field to find specific articles, and an avatar image representing the blog's author or character.

Body
The body is divided into two main sections:

Main Section: This section contains the title "Would cats be astronauts?" and a featured image of a cat. The theory about cats being astronauts is presented and discussed here.

Related Articles Section: In this section, five related articles about different aspects of cats are presented. Each article has an image, a title, and a brief description.

Footer
The footer contains the copyright year and the name of the blog or company.

Style
The blog's style is defined in the "style.css" file, which is linked to the HTML document. The CSS is responsible for styling all elements, making the layout attractive and responsive.

## Responsiveness
The blog is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. For devices with a screen width larger than 1120 pixels, the layout becomes two columns, making better use of the available space.

## Fonts
The blog uses the "Mulish" font from Google Fonts, in the 400, 600, and 700 variants, to ensure good readability and aesthetic appearance.
